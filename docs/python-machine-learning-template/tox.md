# ðŸ§ª ** Leveraging `tox.ini `for Configuration Management** 

In a Python project, maintaining consistent code quality and adhering to specific coding standards is crucial. Tools like `Flake8`, `Black`, `isort`, `mypy`, and others can assist with this. However, each of these tools may require a separate configuration file to read their settings and apply them to your code. If you're using multiple such tools, managing individual configuration files can become cumbersome.

Enter **tox**! With tox, you can consolidate the settings for all these tools into a single `tox.ini` file, eliminating the need for multiple separate files. This makes your configuration management more streamlined and efficient.


Here's an example of how you can define settings for `flake8` and `isort` in the `tox.ini` file:

```toml

[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = E203
exclude = .git, __pycache__, .venv
max-line-length = 88
use-flake8-tabs = true

[isort]
profile = black
multi_line_output = 3

```


!!! note

    It's important to note that tox is more than just a configuration file manager. The [**tox project**](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) is a powerful tool with a host of advanced features that you can explore for more complex use cases. In this template, we've primarily used `tox.ini` as a single source configuration file, but tox offers much more!
