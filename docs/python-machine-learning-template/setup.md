## üé• Demo

This demo assumes that you've already set up your own project using the Python Machine Learning Template. For the purposes of this demonstration, we'll refer to this project as `Demo Project`.

The video tutorial will guide you through the necessary steps for setting up your project. Please note that the video does not include the process of clearing the readme at the end of the setup.

For more detailed instructions and additional information, please refer to the documentation provided below. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of the setup process and how to clear the readme.

## Command usage

=== "üêß  Linux / üçé MacOS"

    For setting up the project, `project_setup.sh` script has been provided along with some options.



    ### üßë‚Äçüíª Steps:

    1. Open terminal and navigate to your project directory.

        **Case (a): Setting up in _Development_ environment** 
        
        If you are setting up the project inside **development** environment, use:

        ```shell
        source project_setup.sh --install --install-dev
        ```

        Incase you are working behind a proxy, use the following command instead:
            
        ```shell
        source project_setup.sh --install --install-dev --use-proxy
        ```
        

        **Case (b): If you are setting up the project in _production_ environment**, 
        
        If you are setting up the project inside **production** environment, you may only require base packages to be installaed, use:

        ```shell
        source project_setup.sh --install
        ```

        If you are working behind a proxy, use the following command:
        
        ```shell

        source project_setup.sh --install --use-proxy
        
        ```

    2. If you are setting up the project first time using this template, then you should replace contents of the README.md with the name of your project:

        ```
        source project_setup.sh --clear-readme
        ``` 
    
        ***Use this command only once in the development environment. DO NOT run this once you write your own readme. Also, do not run this in production environment.***



    #### üìù Important Note 

    *  For any other package installation apart from the listed packages in `Pipfile` use `pipenv` as follows:

        ```
        pipenv install package_name
        ```

        By default, `pipenv` loads all the `.env` variables, therefore you need to unset the proxy first if you are not behind proxy.

        Use the following command:

        ```
        source project_setup.sh --unset-proxy
        ```
        You should then be able to install packages using pipenv as stated above.

    *  During package installation, the packages are downloaded and cached. This consumes a lot of disk, hence you should clear pip and pipenv cache from time to time. Use the following command:

        ```
        source project_setup.sh --remove-cache
        ``` 


    *  ‚úÖ To ensure a conflict-free environment setup, it is strongly recommended to always run the `project_setup.sh` script to create a virtual environment for your project.


    *  ‚ùóYou should run the script **ONLY** using the `source` command to ensure that the virtual environment `.venv` is automatically activated at the end of setup in the current shell session.

    *  ü§ö If you have installed Python virtual environment and virtual environment wrapper and have set up a centralized location for virtual environments, you may have added the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

        ```
        # virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
        export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
        export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
        source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
        ```

    

=== "ü™ü Windows"

    For setting up the project, `project_setup.bat` script has been provided along with some options.


    ### üßë‚Äçüíª Steps:

    1. Open Command Prompt (CMD) and navigate to your project directory.

        **Case (a): Setting up in _Development_ environment** 
    
        If you are setting up the project inside **development** environment, use:

        ```shell
        project_setup.bat --install --install-dev
        ```

        Incase you are working behind a proxy, use the following command instead:
                
        ```shell
        project_setup.bat --install --install-dev --use-proxy
        ```


        **Case (b): If you are setting up the project in _production_ environment**, 
    
        If you are setting up the project inside **production** environment, you may only require base packages to be installaed, use:

        ```shell
        project_setup.bat --install
        ```

        If you are working behind a proxy, use the following command:
        
        ```shell
        project_setup.bat --install --use-proxy
        ```

    2. If you are setting up the project first time using this template, then you should replace contents of the README.md with the name of your project:

        ```
        project_setup.bat --clear-readme
        ``` 
    
        ***Use this command only once in the development environment. DO NOT run this once you write your own readme. Also, do not run this in production environment.***



    #### üìù Important Note 

    *  For any other package installation apart from the listed packages in `Pipfile` use `pipenv` as follows:

        ```
        pipenv install package_name
        ```

        By default, `pipenv` loads all the `.env` variables, therefore you need to unset the proxy first if you are not behind proxy.

        Use the following command:

        ```
        project_setup.bat --unset-proxy
        ```
        You should then be able to install packages using pipenv as stated above.

    *  During package installation, the packages are downloaded and cached. This consumes a lot of disk, hence you should clear pip and pipenv cache from time to time. Use the following command:

        ```
        project_setup.bat --remove-cache
        ``` 

    *  ‚úÖ To ensure a conflict-free environment setup, it is strongly recommended to always run the `project_setup.bat` script to create a virtual environment for your project.

    *  ‚ùóFor security reasons, organizations may prevent running .bat scripts on PowerShell. You should run the script **ONLY** on Command Prompt (CMD) to ensure that everything runs without any errors.

    *  ‚õî Ideally, you should see a `.venv` virtual environment already activated in the Command Prompt (CMD). However, if it's not activated, please follow these steps to activate it before installing any package using `pipenv`:

        1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD).
        2. Navigate to the project directory.
        3. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command: `.venv\Scripts\Activate`

            This command will activate the virtual environment and change your prompt to indicate that you're now working within it.

        4. You can now proceed with installing packages using `pipenv`
