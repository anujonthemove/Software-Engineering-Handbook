<summary> <b> 2. ðŸ¤” What is the use of `workspace` folder? </b> </summary>

*	The `workspaces` folder is intended for scenarios where multiple people are working on the same project on the same machine. Inside the `workspaces` folder, you can create subfolders named after each developer, allowing them to clone the project and work on different branches. These subdirectories are not tracked by Git, enabling multiple people to collaborate on the same project without conflicts. To incorporate changes, developers can merge their branches with a common branch located at the root level.
