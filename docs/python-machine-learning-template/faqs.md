# ðŸ“» **Frequently Asked Questions**

ðŸ¤” Is this project structure/repository inspired from cookie-cutter project template?

In short, no. While there may be similarities in naming conventions, the Python Machine Learning Template was created based on the specific needs of machine learning projects, such as reinforcement learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. However, we do appreciate the Jupyter Notebook naming convention used in the cookie-cutter project template and we recommend that users should follow it.
