# Python Machine Learning Template



## 📚 Philosophy 🧠

This template is designed around the three core components of a Machine Learning project: Data, Code, and Models. The goal is to keep these components together in the project structure, making it easier to manage and maintain.

- **Data & Models**: 📊 These are integral parts of the project and should be included within the project structure.
- **Code**: 🔢 The codebase is typically version-controlled and pushed to a remote repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any cloud-based Git service.

    ### ⚠️ Common Issues 🚧

    Often, developers face the following challenges:

    - **Data and Model Segregation**: 📂 At the end of the day, developers often find themselves segregating data, models, and other artifacts from the code before pushing changes to the remote repository.
    - **Accidental Uploads**: 🙈 There's a risk of accidentally pushing unwanted files to the remote repository.

    ### ✅ Our Solution 🎯

    This template addresses these issues with the following features:

    - **.gitignore**: 🛡️ A well-crafted .gitignore file ensures that unwanted files are not pushed to the remote repository.
    - **Pre-defined Project Structure**: 🗂️ The template provides a structured layout to store all your files, data, models, and other artifacts. This structure remains consistent throughout the project's life cycle, promoting cleanliness and organization.
