*  â›” Ideally, you should see a `.venv` virtual environment already activated in the Command Prompt (CMD). However, if it's not activated, please follow these steps to activate it before installing any package using `pipenv`:

   1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD).
   2. Navigate to the project directory.
   3. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

      `.venv\Scripts\Activate`

      This command will activate the virtual environment and change your prompt to indicate that you're now working within it.

   4. You can now proceed with installing packages using `pipenv` or running other commands within the activated virtual environment.

* For Windows users, it's important to note that proxy settings made through editing the environment variables `$HTTP_PROXY` and `$HTTPS_PROXY` require elevated permissions.

* To simplify handling proxy url for every pip install, you can now utilize `Pipenv`. Pipenv automatically reads the environment variables and incorporates them into your project.
